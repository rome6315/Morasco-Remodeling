                        <h3>Morasco Remodeling is owned and operated by Perrin Morasco, a Pittsburgh native
                            with roots in North Huntingdon, North Versailles, Penn Hills, Apollo, Bloomfield and
                            Lawrenceville.
                        </h3>
                        <p>A message from Perrin: I learned the trade from my grandfather starting at an
                            early age before embarking on a career in Graphic Design in the early 90’s. During my 20 year
                            tenure as a designer, I continued to work in the remodeling field in my spare time, helping
                            friends, relatives and neighbors with their projects. I found that my expertise in the Graphic
                            Design field lent itself well to the remodeling/decorating industry giving me a unique
                            perspective when drafting up plans for a remodeling job. In 2011 I decided to take on
                            remodeling as a full time career because of my love of the craft and the satisfaction that comes
                            from seeing my customers happy. Going above and beyond to gain their trust is as equally
                            important to me. Most of my customers I now consider my friends, and they are free to contact
                            me when the have any questions or just need advice on a repair or project they are attempting
                            to do on their own. I look forward to serving your needs. Don’t hesitate to give me a call or
                            shoot me a text. I'll do whatever I can to solve your problem or meet your needs, and if it’s a
                            field I don’t practice, I can recommend someone who can help you.
